                    <h3><a href="https://freakingloki.github.io/Resume/" target="_blank" title="the resume website you are currently viewing">Resume Website</a></h3>
                    <p><em>Construction began September 10 2022</em></p>
                    <br>
                        <p>This resume was the first project I began working on in September of 2022 as I began classes for Full Stack Development. This resume displays my abilities with HTML5 and CSS at the moment and is constantly being updated to reflect my <a href="./skills.html" title="navigate to skills page">skills</a>, <a href="./projects.html" title="navigate to projects page">projects</a>, and <a href="./experience.html" title="navigate to experience page">work experience</a>.</p>
                        <p>For this project I used Visual Studio Code and started by creating a fairly barebones single-page website that was not hosted online anywhere. Once I learned about how to use Github Pages to host small projects I put the resume website online and continued adjusting and troubleshooting the CSS styling.</p>
                        <p>Once I had the styling nearly complete I began to expand the webpage and started adding more pages to turn it into a more comprehensive website so that I could practice building an organized file system. I poked around to try to learn how most people handled CSS styling for multi-page websites and found that smaller projects like this one usually had one comprehensive CSS stylesheet for the entire site.</p>
                        <p>This project is currently in another cleanup stage where I'll be adjusting CSS styling to better suit the multiple pages I have added to the structure of the site. I started building this project before I learned how to use CSS Flexbox styling.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://freakingloki.github.io/CheatSheet/" target="_blank" title="a website dedicated to HTML and CSS code">Cheat Sheet Website</a></h3>
                    <p><em>Construction began October 2 2022</em></p>
                        <p>This site is a series of small tables of commonly used HTML and CSS code and how to use those bits of code. It contains links to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" title="Mozilla's fantastic documentation site">Mozilla Developer Network</a> pages for more detailed information and a uses a color palette found using the <a href="https://coolors.co/119da4-dadff7-b24c63-b8b42d-f8f991" target="_blank" title="a neat color selecting tool">Coolers</a> tool.</p>
                        <p>This is a webpage that was a project that was assigned to me from the excellent <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank" title="where I learned most of what I know">Codecademy</a> online school. It was the first off-platform assignment they had me do. I use from time to time as a quick-reference tool while working on other projects. It is not as detailed or comprehensive as other tools like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" title="W3Schools">W3S</a>, but this particular guide is easier for me to follow because I made it for me.</p>
                        <p>Currently on the to-do list for this project is expansion and tidying up of some of the styling. There are two or three tables that are nearly non-existant (though their html structure has been laid out) and every table is missing several important bits of information. I'm sure this site will be something I work on for a long time as i learn more and more, similar to the resume site which I will need to keep up to date as well.</p>

                            <p>This site contains content based on a joke I enjoyed in one of my favorite podcasts. My purpose behind building this site was to practice using CSS Flexbox and combined with media queries in order to allow the site to adapt for different sized screens including tablets and other mobile devices. It heavily features images pulled from <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" title="free hi-res photos">Unsplash</a> which provides free high resolution photos.</p>
                            <p>The page is designed to have a header with the name of the buisness and page navigation. It also has three sections featuring products, menu items and team members. The footer of the page includes contact information and hours of operation.</p>
                            <p>The buisness is completely fictional, but not something I entirely made up on my own. I was inspired by a joke in the My Brother My Brother and Me podcast. The footer on the page includes a short blurb stating the as much and my personal contact info if anyone finds any issues with it.</p>
