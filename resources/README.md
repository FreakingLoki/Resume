#Jesse's Personal Website
##Purpose
I began this project in order to build a personal space online to post my resume, and give people a window into my life.
I wanted to build this while studying the Full Stack Developer track on Codecademy.
Each page has a "last updated" blurb so that any interested parties can follow along while I develop my site and my skills.


##Design Notes and Future Plans:

###Colors and their uses:
*rgb(228, 253, 225) text color #E4FDE1
*rgb(20, 1, 82) background color #140152
*rgb(4, 5, 46) nav header footer background color #04052E
*rgb(69, 105, 144) border color #456990
*rgb(245, 138, 7) anchor color #F58A07
*rgb(248, 242, 114) anchor hover color #F8F272


##TO DO:
*currently the skills table is too condensed. add spacing between rows to clarify what image goes with what skill
*add a:active to both a and a.nav-button elements
*make sure ever <a> has a title that is short and sweet
*make the email address open an email form for the user
*recondense experience.html, and skills.html pages into the index.html page
*add blog.html page
*take current index.html page and rename it resume.html
*make new index.html that links out to resume, projects, and contact pages.
