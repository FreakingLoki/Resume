        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I enjoy video and board games with my friends and family. I play mostly strategy, roleplaying, and shooter games. My wife and I love to watch movies and tv shows together, we're horror and thriller fans. My daughter and I play board games, Nintendo games, and play outside together. I've recently started getting into woodworking. I listen to a lot of podcasts while I work, mostly comedy, news, and science with a little bit of true crime. I also enjoy many types of music but my favorites are probably alternative, punk, and indie rock including artists like Jack White and Gary Clark Jr.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I currently live in Central Maine which is where I grew up. I was born in Alabama while my parents were stationed there with the Air Force. We moved back north when they got out of the Air Force to be closer to family. When I graduated high school I tried out college and spent three years studying Civil Engineering in Vermont before returning home and beginning work with Performance Foodservice.</p>
