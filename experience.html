        <p>As stated above, my main responsibilities currently with this job are to unload PFG's (Performance Foodgroup's) trucks as they return to the warehouse and check the quality, temperature, use by dates, and reason for return of any product that the customers send back with the truck drivers. In the small breaks I get in between those trucks I help out with processing credit requests for customers and I occasionaly help out with inventory control duties such as counting inventory, dealing with spoilage, transfering product into the freezer, or preparing products for donation.</p>
